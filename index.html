<h1>Hey there, I'm Hedgehawk11</h1>
<p>I make hot garbage, I also like thinking with portals.</p>
<p>I wrote this whole page myself, even though it stinks</p>
<p>My main operating system is Kubuntu (KDE best desktop environment), But i have a windows partition for any incompatible apps with wine/proton</p>
<p>I use Kdenlive for editing, and it wants to die a lot</p>
