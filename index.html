<h1>Hey there, I'm Hedgehawk11</h1>
<p>I make minecraft mods and stuff, I also like thinking with portals.</p>
<p>I wrote this whole page myself, even though it stinks</p>
<p>My 2 main operating systems are ubuntu 24.04(Royal Wombat)and windows 10(because Win11 is not good)</p>
<p>all my stuff is FOSS(Free and Open Source Software) (minus SOME of my mods but I want them to be FOSS)</p>
<p>See you later</p>
