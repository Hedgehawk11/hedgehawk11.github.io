<h1>opinions on replit</h1>

<p>Replit is a great platform for learning to code. It provides an easy-to-use interface and allows you to run codedirectly in the browser. I highly recommend it for beginners!</p>

<p>Is what I would like to say but, well, replit has failed to support thire free plan. A sadly common theme with so many companys nowadays *cough cough* discord *cough cough*. replit needs to remember the free user community, things started going downhill when repl.co domains got taken down in favor of the dumber deployments. it seems like that once replit got rid of the education users, replit just tried to become a paid service, now I diched them a while ago in favor in the better Github codespaces + pages</p>
